## 📝 Key Components

- **model.pkl:** The pre-trained regression model that predicts housing prices
- **data_transformation.pkl:** The preprocessor object for transforming user input
- **app.py:** The main Flask application that handles web routes and prediction logic
- **predict_pipeline.py:** A dedicated module to load the model and make predictions on new data
- **templates/:** Contains the HTML files for the user interface
- **notebook/:** Jupyter Notebooks detailing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training process

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Input:** The user navigates through a 7-step form on the web interface to provide detailed property features
2. **Data Processing:** The Flask backend receives the form data and uses a custom data pipeline to transform it into a format suitable for the model
3. **Prediction:** The processed data is fed into the trained machine learning model, which generates a price prediction
4. **Result Display:** The estimated house price is sent back to the web page and displayed to the user in a clean, readable format

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Step Form:** An intuitive 7-step form for detailed and organized property feature input
- **Interactive UI:** A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Instant housing price estimates powered by a robust machine learning model
- **Data-Driven Accuracy:** The model is trained on the comprehensive Ames, Iowa housing dataset for reliable predictions
